    <p> <em>Self-taught Web Developer</em>    </p>
    <p>I am currently enrolled in a BS CS degree in <a href="nu.edu.pk">National university for Computer and emerging sciences</a>. I have a strong interest in web development and data science and since universities do not offer those courses in the initial semesters, I decided to go ahead and start learning web development on my own. This site will evolve as I learn more and implement that knowledge to make it better, however, I will preserve the original versions so you can see my progress! </p>

    <h3>Programming languages I know and where I learned them</h3>
    <ul>
        
        <li><strong>Python 3</strong>: Learned it from the complete python 3 bootcamp by jose portilla on udemy.</li>
        <li><strong>C</strong>: Learned it from a programming fundementals course from my university and CodewithHarry youtube Channel.</li>
        <li><strong>C++</strong>Being a superset of C made this easy to learn. CodeWithHarry and the apnaCollege were two amazing channels that I used to about this language. Unfortunately, both of them teach in hindi so some of my international readers would not be able to understand what they are saying.</li>
